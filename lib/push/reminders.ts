/**
 * Push workout-reminder flow — the trigger side of web push. Run from the daily
 * lifecycle cron (app/api/cron/lifecycle) with a service-role admin client.
 *
 * For each user who has a web push subscription and an active, in-progress
 * program, it fires up to two reminders:
 *   - workout_due  — there are unlogged sessions scheduled for today.
 *   - week_review  — it's the first day of a new program week and the week that
 *                    just ended had logged activity worth reviewing.
 *
 * The opt-in IS the subscription: turning "Workout reminders" off in Settings
 * deletes the row, so this flow simply finds nothing to send. Each send is
 * claimed in push_sends (migration 0037) with an idempotent dedup key, so a
 * re-run or partial cron never double-notifies. Time-of-day comes from the cron
 * schedule (14:00 UTC); per-user quiet hours are a follow-up (needs a profile
 * timezone column — none exists yet).
