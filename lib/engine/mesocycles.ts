/**
 * Mesocycle allocation (spec §4a).
 *
 * Programs run four sequential mesocycles: Base → Build → Peak → Taper.
 * Base is always the largest. Allocations scale from 20-week reference
 * anchors (both summing cleanly to 20 with a 2-week A-race taper):
 *
 *   Non-highly-trained: Base 9 / Build 6 / Peak 3 / Taper 2   (3-week micro)
 *   Highly-trained:     Base 8 / Build 6 / Peak 4 / Taper 2   (4-week micro)
 *
 * For other durations we scale the non-taper portion proportionally and let
 * Base absorb the remainder (keeping it largest). The taper is protected:
 * its length comes from the highest-priority race's protocol (§6), not from
 * scaling. General-fitness programs omit the taper entirely.
