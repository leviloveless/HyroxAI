/**
 * Taper insertion (spec §6).
 *
 * Tapers override the standard microcycle, working backward from each race:
 *   - A race: 2 weeks, −30% then −30% again (cumulative ≈ −51% from peak)
 *   - B race: 1 week,  −40% (a mini-taper; quality work is retained)
 *   - C race: none — train through; the week is unchanged and the race day
 *             simply replaces that day's session
 *
 * Cuts reduce from the pre-taper progression level (the week before the taper
 * window). For multi-race programs, each race's taper is applied independently
 * and the normal microcycle progression resumes on the weeks after it — the
 * final A race sits at the end of the program, so its taper coincides with the
 * Taper mesocycle and forms the program's peak.
