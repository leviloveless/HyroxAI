/**
 * Triathlon — Ironman 70.3 and 140.6 (SportConfig registry entries).
 *
 * The deterministic periodized engine for these sports lives in
 * `lib/engine/ironman` — this file now holds ONLY the DATA registry entries
 * (`tri_70_3` / `tri_140_6` + `TRI_SPORTS`), the band / needs / zone / count
 * tables those configs reference, and the per-discipline level-detection helpers
 * (`swimLevelFromCss` / `bikeLevelFromFtp`) that the skeleton adapter imports.
 *
 * The engine functions are RE-EXPORTED from ironman at the bottom so every
 * existing import site (`@/lib/engine/sports/triathlon`) keeps working. The
 * dependency runs one-way: this file → ironman, never ironman → this file.
 *
 * Values from docs/future-phases/17 + research-triathlon (Friel/MyProCoach/
 * TrainingPeaks/Seiler). Distinguishes 70.3 from 140.6 throughout.
