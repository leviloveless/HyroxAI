/**
 * Adaptation Engine (Phase 2 — phase2-spec.md §4). Deterministic, no AI.
 *
 * Reads one completed week's logs, computes compliance + strain signals, and
 * applies an ordered rule set to produce revised targets for the upcoming
 * week. The AI (session refill) never decides how much volume changes — this
 * module is the only adaptation authority, so every change is auditable and
 * unit-testable. Mirrors the v1 split: engine owns the math, Haiku fills
 * content.
 *
 * Volume bounds: hold / earned-bump adjustments are clamped to ±20% of the
 * target week's original skeleton values. Early deload and re-anchor are
 * exempt — they apply the engine's standard −40% deload math (a defined safe
 * operation, like a scheduled deload), and the re-anchor decay respectively.
