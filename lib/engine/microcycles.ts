/**
 * Microcycle sequencing + volume progression (spec §4b).
 *
 * Microcycles repeat continuously across the non-taper weeks
 * (Base → Build → Peak) until a taper begins:
 *
 *   Non-highly-trained (3-week): rebound, increase, deload
 *   Highly-trained     (4-week): rebound, increase, increase, deload
 *
 * Volume math:
 *   - rebound  → hold the volume from the prior increase week
 *   - increase → add the lesser of (1.5 mi, 7.5%) to mileage and the lesser of
 *                (15 min, 10%) to cardio, over the current held level
 *   - deload   → −40% mileage & cardio (the held level is NOT reduced, so the
 *                next rebound resumes from the pre-deload peak)
 *
 * The first week is a rebound that simply holds the starting volume.
