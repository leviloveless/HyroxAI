/**
 * Session-slot assignment (spec §5).
 *
 * For each week the engine decides WHICH sessions happen and their intensity
 * (run type + goal zone, lift split, hybrid), then maps them onto the user's
 * training days. The AI later fills the concrete content (paces, exercises,
 * sets × reps). The engine never invents volume the periodization didn't call
 * for — it only distributes the prescribed sessions.
 *
 * Fixed rules:
 *   - 3 lifts / week (upper, lower, full) during Base/Build/Peak
 *   - Runs 3–8 / week, scaled by phase and running experience
 *   - Hybrid frequency ramps Base → Peak (earlier if hybrid-inexperienced)
 *   - Taper weeks trim volume; a race week is a shakeout + the race itself
