/**
 * Periodized strength prescription (Review #4).
 *
 * Replaces the old flat model (full-body 5–7, upper/lower a fixed 12–15, a
 * static ~75–80% 5RM start, no plyometrics) with an evidence-based scheme:
 *
 *   - HEAVY, LOW-REP MAX STRENGTH drives the full-body day. Heavy strength +
 *     plyometrics improve running economy and delay fatigue far more than
 *     hypertrophy-rep work, and add little mass — which matters in a bodyweight-
 *     carrying 8 km event (Rønnestad & Mujika 2014; Blagrove 2018; Beattie 2017).
 *   - Upper/lower days run a MODERATE strength scheme (6–10 reps, dropping
 *     toward peak) — strength-biased, not the old hypertrophy 12–15.
 *   - The LUNGE pattern (HYROX sandbag lunges) keeps HIGH-REP MUSCULAR
 *     ENDURANCE — the one place high reps are sport-specific.
 *   - Load PROGRESSES across the microcycle (intensity climbs on increase weeks,
 *     backs off on deloads) and is autoregulated with an RIR (reps-in-reserve)
 *     target (Helms 2016), so it isn't a static number.
 *   - A PLYOMETRIC / reactive element is added in Base and Build for RFD and
 *     tendon stiffness → running economy (Barnes & Kilding 2015).
 *
 * Deterministic + pure (engine owns the math, like the running side); assembly
 * applies these schemes over whatever the AI returned so strength is auditable
 * and periodized rather than guessed.
