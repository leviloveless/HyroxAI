/**
 * Canonical run-workout descriptions (Tasks #2, #3, #4, #5).
 *
 * Every run session carries a short (1–2 sentence) explanation of what the run
 * is and how to execute it. These are attached deterministically during
 * assembly — not left to the AI — so the exact coaching protocol the athlete
 * expects is always shown, regardless of the generated paces/distances.
 *
 * Progression runs read differently by running experience (Tasks #4):
 * beginners get a simpler two-effort build; intermediate/advanced runners get
 * the three-block build.

    "Fartlek runs can be run by feel or on time. Warm up 1–2 miles easy, then run descending intervals — 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, then 1 minute — at RPE 5 (~10–15K pace), each followed by a 1.5-minute easy jog, and cool down 1–2 miles easy.",

  threshold:
    "Zone 4 running at true lactate threshold — 'comfortably hard,' about 20–30 sec/mile slower than 5K pace. The primary quality run of the peak phase, it lifts the pace you can sustain on race day.",
  interval:
    "Warm up with a 5-minute easy jog, then run 6–8 rounds of 800m at your interval pace (about your 5K pace or a touch faster) with a 1-minute slow jog recovery between reps, and finish with a 5-minute easy walk cool-down.",
