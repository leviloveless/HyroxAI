const OUTPUT_CONTRACT = `OUTPUT FORMAT — respond with a single JSON object and nothing else (no prose, no markdown fences):

{
  "weeks": [
    {
      "weekNumber": <int>,
      "days": [
        {
          "day": "mon" | "tue" | "wed" | "thu" | "fri" | "sat" | "sun",
          "sessions": [ <Session>, ... ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

A <Session> is exactly one of:
- Run:    { "kind": "run", "runType": "easy|fartlek|progression|long|tempo|threshold|interval|hybrid_run", "durationMin": <number>, "paceMinMile": "m:ss", "distanceMiles": <number>, "goalZone": <1-5> }
- Lift:   { "kind": "lift", "liftType": "upper|lower|full", "movements": [ { "pattern": "squat|hip_hinge|lunge|horizontal_press|vertical_press|horizontal_pull|vertical_pull", "sets": <int>, "repRange": "5-7", "suggestedWeight": "optional string" } ] }
- Hybrid: { "kind": "hybrid", "goalZone": <1-5>, "elements": [ { "exercise": "row erg", "prescription": "500m" }, { "exercise": "run", "prescription": "400m @ 7:30 min/mile (threshold)" } ] }

Rules:
- Return one "days" entry for every training day that the skeleton marks with a run/lift/hybrid slot. Do NOT return entries for rest days or race days — those are handled separately.
- The sessions you return for a day MUST match, in kind and order, the slots the skeleton lists for that day. Fill in content only.
- Match each run's runType and each session's goalZone to what the skeleton specifies for that slot.
- Every full training week (weeks with 3 lift slots) must include all 7 movement patterns across its lift sessions.
- Keep numbers realistic and internally consistent (durationMin ≈ distanceMiles × paceMinMile).`;
