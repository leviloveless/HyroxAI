- Zone 1 (<60% max HR): recovery / very easy
- Zone 2 (60–70%): easy aerobic / base building
- Zone 3 (70–80%): moderate aerobic / tempo
- Zone 4 (80–90%): threshold / lactate threshold
- Zone 5 (90–100%): max effort / VO2 max`;

/** Run-type character + pace guidance (spec §5a, Q14/Q17). */
export const RUN_GUIDANCE = `Run types and how to prescribe them (the engine decides WHICH type each day is; you fill in realistic paces/durations that match the protocol):
- easy: Zone 1–2, conversational pace, aerobic base.
- fartlek: Zone 2 average with hard surges; programmed only in the Base and Build phases. Protocol: warm up 1–2 mi easy, then descending run intervals — 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, then 1 minute — at RPE 5 (~10–15K pace), each followed by a 1.5-minute easy jog, then cool down 1–2 mi easy. Set durationMin to cover warmup + the ~36 min of intervals + jogs + cooldown.
- progression: programmed only in the Peak and Taper phases; builds from easy to a hard finish. BEGINNER runners: 10 min easy warm-up, 20–30 min at standard comfortable aerobic pace (1–2 min/mile faster than easy), then a comfortably hard threshold effort for the final 10–15%, 5 min easy cool-down. INTERMEDIATE/ADVANCED runners: 5 min easy warm-up, 20 min easy/warm-up pace, 20 min at marathon/half-marathon race pace, 20 min at comfortably hard tempo (threshold) pace, 5 min easy cool-down. Goal zone ~3.
- long: Zone 2, extended duration, aerobic development. Every week has exactly one long run. Start Zone 1–2 and allow heart-rate drift toward the top of Zone 3 over a 75–90 min effort without entering Zone 4.
- tempo: Zone 3–4, 20–35 min continuous at ~80–90% max HR (≈ half-marathon pace); introduced in the Build phase, one per week.
- threshold: Zone 4, true lactate threshold, "comfortably hard," ~20–30 sec/mile slower than 5K pace; the primary quality run in the Peak phase.
- interval: Zone 4–5; programmed in the 2nd half of Build, throughout Peak, and some Taper weeks. Protocol: 5-min easy jog warm-up, then 6–8 rounds of 800m at goal 5K pace with a 1-minute slow jog recovery between reps, 5-min easy walk cool-down.
- hybrid_run: Zone 4 (threshold pace); these are the runs inside hybrid sessions and already count toward the weekly run total.

Pace: if the athlete provided benchmarks (mile / 5K / 10K), derive paces from them. Threshold ≈ 20–30 s/mile slower than 5K pace; tempo ≈ half-marathon pace; easy ≈ 1.5–2.5 min/mile slower than 5K pace. If no benchmarks are given, prescribe by zone/effort and give a reasonable pace estimate in min/mile.`;

/** Lifting rules (spec §5b, Q16/Q23). */
export const LIFT_GUIDANCE = `Weightlifting: exactly 3 sessions in a full training week — 1 upper, 1 lower, 1 full body.
Rep ranges: full-body sessions 5–7 reps (strength); upper- and lower-body sessions 12–15 reps (hypertrophy/endurance).
Every full training week MUST include all 7 non-negotiable movement patterns across its lift sessions:
squat, hip_hinge, lunge, horizontal_press, vertical_press, horizontal_pull, vertical_pull.
For each movement give: pattern, number of sets, and rep range. If a 5-rep-max benchmark was provided, you may suggest a starting weight (~75–80% of 5RM) for that lift.`;

/** Hybrid (HYROX-specific) rules (spec §5c, Q18). */
export const HYBRID_GUIDANCE = `Hybrid sessions simulate the HYROX format: threshold-pace runs interleaved with non-running cardio/strength stations ("events").
Structure EVERY hybrid session as exactly 4 runs and 4 events, alternating run → event → run → event … Each run is 1000m at threshold pace (give the pace). So the "elements" array for a hybrid should contain 8 entries: 4 run elements each prescribed as "1000m @ <pace> (threshold)" and 4 event elements from the station library, interleaved.
Rotate the events across the week's hybrid sessions: when a week has two hybrid sessions, choose the 4 events for each so that, together, all of the week's HYROX stations are covered at least once (don't repeat the same 4 events in both sessions).
Prescribe each event as reps / distance / calories. Assign a goal HR zone (typically Zone 4). Each hybrid session should total between 25 and 60 minutes of WORK time (excluding warmup/cooldown). Keep the set of hybrid workouts repeatable within a mesocycle and rotate/replace them between mesocycles.`;

export const TAPER_GUIDANCE = `Race tapers (the engine already sets the reduced volume; you fill the sessions to match its intent):
- A race (peak priority): a 2-week taper for maximum freshness. Week 1 sits around 60–70% of the peak week; race week around 40–50%, with long workouts cut 50–70%. Keep intensity high but drop duration and frequency — do NOT remove hard efforts or speed work, that preserves sharpness. In race week cut heavy lifting/strength work, and include short "opener" sessions (e.g. 2 days out): brief, high-RPM bursts or quick strides so the legs feel snappy without fatigue.
- B race (secondary): a mini-taper that protects training rhythm — the race week's planned duration is cut ~40–50%. Keep hard efforts in place but reduce the number of reps / time at high zones. Avoid deep, exhausting efforts 2–3 days before the race.
- C race (tune-up): NO formal taper — train right through it. The day before can be off or a very short easy jog/spin, but don't sacrifice the training block. Treat the C race itself as a high-quality hard workout.`;
