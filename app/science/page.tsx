          Duravel isn&apos;t a template. Every program is built on the peer-reviewed science of
          training <em>load</em>, <em>volume</em>, and <em>intensity</em> — the same principles
          coaches use to decide how hard and how much you should train for your event and the time
          you actually have.

          Can ten hours a week match forty?
        </h2>
        <p className="mt-3 text-zinc-600">
          Partly — and knowing exactly where &quot;partly&quot; ends is what makes a plan work. You
          can hold a similar training <em>effect</em> across very different weekly hours by turning
          intensity up as volume comes down. But that trade only holds for some adaptations, and it
          gets more expensive the longer your event. Three findings from the research drive how
          Duravel programs you.
        </p>
        <div className="mt-6 grid gap-4 sm:grid-cols-1">
          <Finding n="1" title="Training load isn't one simple number">
            Every load metric weights hard work disproportionately — that&apos;s why a short, hard
            session can equal a long, easy one on paper. But two sessions with the same &quot;load&quot;
            can build different things. The <em>pattern</em> of training matters, not just the total.
          </Finding>
          <Finding n="2" title="Intensity replaces volume — for some things, not others">
            High intensity can preserve your VO₂max and aerobic power on a fraction of the hours. It
            cannot buy the adaptations that only accumulate with time: fat-burning efficiency,
            capillary and heart adaptations, tougher tendons, and <em>durability</em> — your
            resistance to fading late in a long race.
          </Finding>
          <Finding n="3" title="The tradeoff scales with your event and training age">
            For a short, punchy event (DEKA, a hard metcon), intensity is nearly a full substitute
            for volume. For a five-to-seventeen-hour Ironman, it isn&apos;t — those races are won on
            exactly the volume-built traits above. And the fitter you already are, the more the
            remaining gains live in volume.

          We hold ourselves to the evidence. The core principles here rest on decades of endurance
          and exercise-physiology research across many independent studies. Some areas are newer:
          HYROX has only begun to be studied in the lab, and DEKA hasn&apos;t been formally studied
          yet — so for those we lean on transferable physiology and coaching experience, and we say
          so. The full methodology lists the studies and flags exactly what is settled versus still
          emerging.
